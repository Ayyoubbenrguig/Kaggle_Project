## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

Each project is structured as follows:

```
Project_Folder/
├── data/               # Contains raw data and any processed files
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for analysis and model training
├── src/                # Scripts for data processing and modeling
├── README.md           # Overview of the specific project
└── results/            # Saved models, figures, or other outputs
```

## Skills and Tools Demonstrated

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore and visualize data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing classification, regression, and clustering models.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras for building neural network architectures.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance assessment using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
